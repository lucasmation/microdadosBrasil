Description: A set of simple functions to read most commonly used public microdata on Brazil.
    Downloads and reads the main datasets from IBGE, INEP and MTE for
    all years available on-line. Handles csv and fixed width format (fwf) data, for
    which it includes dictionaries. The core "read_data" function is based on readr
    (for fwf) and data.table (for csv), thus is fast. Metadata harmonization tables
    and wrapper functions, such as read_CENSO, read_PNAD, read_CensoEscolar and
    read_RAIS, handle the details of each dataset-year and make this package easily
    extendable. See the website for microdadosBrasil on github for more details.
